Explain the differences between the retained-mode and the immediate mode rendering.

 Each of these different rendering modes comes with their own benefits and shortcomings.
 Retained mode rendering is declarative while immediate mode is procedural. Additionally, in retained
 mode rendering, the graphics library keeps the scene in memory between frames. In immediate mode,
 the graphics library does not store a scene model between frames. The application is the one who
 keeps track of the scene. Retained mode rendering can also be simpler to use since some of the work
 is done by the API. This also does lead to less flexibility as there are certain constraints to the API.
 With immediate mode rendering, it can be more optimized as there is less overhead required.
 Retained mode can also have higher memory requirements as it needs to deal with a scene model.
